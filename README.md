# 🪝 vLLM.hook
*A modular plugin library for vLLM.*

📄 [Preprint] [**vLLM Hook** v0: A Plug-in for Programming Model Internals on vLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.06588v1)

vLLM.hook is a plugin library designed to let developers and researchers **inspect**, **analyze**, and **steer** the internal operations of large language models running under the **vLLM** inference engine.  

This includes dynamic analysis of:  
- attention patterns  
- attention heads  
- activations  
- custom intervention behaviors  

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Model-agnostic plugin system** for vLLM engines  
- **Extensible worker/analyzer abstraction**  
  - Easy to define new hooks, analyzers, and behaviors  
- **Introspection** of model internals  
- **Interventions** (activation steering, attention control, etc.)  
- **Example applications**:  
  - Safety guardrails  
  - Reranking  
  - Enhanced instruction following

## 📊 Performance Analysis

For a detailed benchmark comparing **vLLM-Hook** against **Native vLLM Eagle** (`ExampleHiddenStatesConnector`) for hidden state extraction, see [`Numerical_Analysis/`](Numerical_Analysis/README.md).

Key takeaways:
- vLLM-Hook (`last_token`) offers significantly lower and prompt-length-invariant latency when only the final-position representation is needed
- vLLM-Hook (`all_tokens`) is numerically equivalent to Native Eagle while avoiding its GPU memory overhead
- Native Eagle requires loading a speculative decoding drafter model, reducing available KV cache

## 🧩 Supported Configurations

Each use case (e.g. attention tracker, activation steering, hidden states extraction, etc) runs across a Cartesian product of configuration axes — execution path (`offline` / `vllm serve`), storage (`rpc` / `disk` / `shm`), disk format (`pt` / `safetensors`), and save mode (`sync` / `async`). See [`configs.md`](configs.md) for code snippets showing how to select each config.

## 📦 Installation
### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/vLLM-Hook.git
cd vLLM-Hook
```

### 2. (Optional) Create an environment 

```bash
conda create -n vllm_hook_env python=3.12 pip
conda activate vllm_hook_env
```

### 3. Install the plugin and dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
pip install -e vllm_hook_plugins
```

---

## 📕 Notebook Setup 

If you plan to use the notebooks under `notebooks/`, you may need to register your environment as a Jupyter kernel:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name vllm_hook_env --display-name "vllm_hook_env"
```

Then inside Jupyter Lab:

```
Kernel → Change Kernel → vllm_hook_env
```

## 👉 Usage Examples (Notebook / CLI)

You can also use the included **`examples/`** and/or **`notebooks/`** directories to explore different functionalities.

### 1. Attention Tracker (In-Model Safety Guardrail)

Notebook 📓: `notebooks/demo_attntracker.ipynb` <br />
CLI 🧰 : 
```bash
python examples/demo_attntracker.py
```

### 2. Core Reranker (In-Model Relevance Ranking)

Notebook 📓: `notebooks/demo_corer.ipynb` <br />
CLI 🧰 : 
```bash
python examples/demo_corer.py
```

### 3. Activation Steering (Enhanced instruction following via activation steering)

Notebook 📓: `notebooks/demo_actsteer.ipynb` <br />
CLI 🧰 : 
```bash
python examples/demo_actsteer.py
```

You can customize model configurations in the `model_configs/` folder, e.g.:

```
model_configs/<example_name>/<model_name>.json
```
For example `model_configs/attention_tracker/granite-3.1-8b-instruct.json`.

## 🏠 Plugin Architecture

The main package is structured as follows:

```
vllm_hook_plugins/
├── analyzers/
│   ├── attention_tracker_analyzer.py
│   ├── core_reranker_analyzer.py
├── workers/
│   ├── probe_hookqk_worker.py
│   ├── steer_activation_worker.py
├── hook_llm.py
├── registry.py
```

Each component handles a key stage of the plugin lifecycle:

- **Registry** — manages available hooks and extensions  
- **Workers** — define execution behavior and orchestration  
- **Analyzers** — optionally conduct analysis based on the saved statistics
